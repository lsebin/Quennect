0. Download Python (if you don't have one)

1. Download Visual Studio Code
   * Base on my years in Penn, I figured Visual Studio Code is the best tool to use especially when we are going to use SSH
   * After downloading VSCode, add following extensions
     1. ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
     2. ms-python.python
     3. donjayamanne.python-extension-pack
     4. ms-toolsai.jupyter
     5. This sth extra, but considering getting Github Copilot (It is free for students! YAY) because it is actually extremely useful and cuts down your coding time to half.
    
2. Download Anaconda (if you don't have one)
   * Check out this link to installation guide (https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)
   * Miniconda should also be fine
  
3. Make Python environment
   * I figured it is easier for us to open or work on any file when we have same version of python libraries. So, we will use python environment.
